  *Whoever influences their decisions
- What do they need? How do they buy?
  *What do they value when buying products and services

## Sources of Value to Consumers
EVC (Economic value to Customer)
E.g. Hybrid Car
- Economic Value: fuel efficiency, so reduce cost
- Psychological Value: viewed as innovator, feels good to be environmentally friendly
- Functional Value: not noisy, comfortable
- Issues with EVC
  *Customer differences
  *Convincing customers
  *Other (fuzzy, qualitative) benefits ignored
  *BUT still useful in pricing, segmentation and new product introduction
