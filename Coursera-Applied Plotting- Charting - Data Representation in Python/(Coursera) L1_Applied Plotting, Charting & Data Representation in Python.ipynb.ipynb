We see a slight drop after deregulation, then a massive spike in spending. And then a significant fall from the period post 2002, much of which is excluded from the original chart. While it's unclear whether the dollar values are in fact corrected for inflation, seems pretty unreasonable to suggest from this data alone that regulations stems cable company investment and infrastructure."
