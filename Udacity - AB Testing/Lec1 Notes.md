- A/B Testing is a general methodology used online when you want to test out a new product or a feature. 
- One set (control set), existing product or feature v.s. New experiment (new version)
- How did these users respond differently in order to determine which version of your feature better?

Should you use A/B testing for every change you are considering or are there certain types of changes that work better than others?

- John Lilly (VC of GreyLock and former President of Mozilla)
“A/B Testing is very useful in helping you climb to the peak of your current mountain but if you want to figure out whether you want to be in this mountain or that mountain, A/B testing isn’t that useful””
- Can test a pretty wide variety of things with A/B testing, everything from some new features, additions to your UI, and different look for AI etc. (e.g. Amazon: discovered had significant increase in revenue from personalized recommendations with A/B Testing)
- Can test “less visible change” as well (e.g. ranking change)
Linkedin tested a change where they were trying to figure out whether they should show a news article or an encouragement to basically add new contacts
Google: ranking between search lists and ads
- Can test stuff that users won’t even notice
e.g. Amazon showed in 2007 that for every 100 ms added to the page, they actually had a 1% decrease in revenue
- Isn’t useful for testing out “new experiences”
Change aversion & novelty effect
One question is what is your baseline for comparison? But two is a question about how much time you need so that you can actually say what is going to be the plateaued experience so that I can actually make a robust decision
- Can’t tell if you are missing something
E.g. Digital camera review site: A/B testing can tell you whether or not you should be showing this camera review above this camera review but can’t really tell if you are missing this entire other camera that you should be reviewing but you aren't reviewing at all.

Examples of when you can & can’t use A/B testing
- Online shopping company: Is my website complete? (whether there are products users
want to buy, that they don't have)
Can’t figure out whether you are carrying all the products users need by running a A/B test
Could try carrying a specific additional product, but if users don't buy it, you still won't know if there's
a different product you're missing. Instead, you might want to try asking users whether there's anything they feel is missing.

- Freemium business model: they want to provide a premium service that offers additional functionality. (To access the premium service, users would need to upgrade, create a log in, and explore the new functionality.)
Wouldn't be able to fully test whether the premium service is a good business decision using A/B testing. Users have to opt into a premium service, so randomly assigning people to one group or another wouldn't really work and you would not have a control group to compare against.
But still valuable information: you could see how many users will read about the additional features or how many will choose to upgrade if you make the choice available.

- Netflix: They create a new algorithm to rank the possible recommendations.
Great use case of A/B testing because there are clear control and experiment groups, the old algorithm and the new algorithm. Also, have clear metrics (e.g. the probability of a user clicking on a recommendation or actually watching the movie)

- Website selling cars: want to if some change will make customers more likely to return or refer their friends
Won’t be able to use A/B testing because it would take too long to see if you get repeat customers (since people buy cars rarely) and you won’t necessarily even have data about whether customers are recommending 
- Company wants to update their brand, including the main logo for their site
 The second case seems like it would be easy to A/B test, and you certainly could collect data about
user behavior with the new and old logo. But they might need some time to get used to
the new logo, so you wouldn't want to make a decision based on a short time window of data collected in an A/B test.
- Suppose you want to test some changes to the initial page of your mobile application. Want to change things like what information is included, what wording you use and what colors you use
Good case for A/B testing. Possible metric can be probability that the user progresses past the initial page.

History of A/B Testing
- A/B testing was around for a long time (maybe not necessarily called A/B testing)
e.g. Agriculture: people would actually divide up their land into sections and then test what would work better for a particular crop or how it grew.
- Medicine: A/B testing is called “clinical trials” and that’s how they determine whether a new drug is effective or not
- Having consistent response from your control and your experiment group is important
- Difference between normal experiments and online A/B test
Online world has a lot of more data but lower resolution
Normal experiment has way less participants and it’s more personal while online A/B testing may have millions of users, thousands of clicks etc and may have trouble distinguishing whether this is a single person, whether there’s multiple people. Is it an internet café computer? 

Business Case Example
Company focused on providing free finance courses: trying to test features that increase student engagement.
Consider change to “Start Now button”: change color from orange to pink  Will this increase how many students explore Audacity's courses?

Potential metrics
- Total number of courses completed: it can take students weeks or months to finish courses, so this metric would simply take too much time to be practical
- Number of Clicks
* Click through rate: number of clicks / number of page views
* Click through probability: Unique visitors who click / unique visitors to page
