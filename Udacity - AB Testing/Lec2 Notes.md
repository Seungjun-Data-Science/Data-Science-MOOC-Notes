## Lec 2 â€“ Policy and Ethics for Experiments

### Medical: Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment
- 600 rural African American men in Tuskegee (1932-1972) thought they were receiving free healthcare from government but they were, in fact, being cited regarding the natural progression of untreated syphilis. This study continued even after penicillin was established as a standard treatment for syphilis and the men were both not treated and not informed of a possible treatment

### Psychology - Milgram Experiment
- (early 1960s) Yale professor Stanley Milgram measured willingness of studied participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to administer electric shocks to a third person. That 3rd person was an actor who simply pretended to be shocked with gradually increasing responses and pleas to stop. The question was, how far the participants would would go in causing pain with prompts from an authority figure. 

- In both cases, participants were subject a high risk for permanent harm.
